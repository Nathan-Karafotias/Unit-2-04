    <h1 style="font-size:20px;">Subheading 1</h1>
    <p style="font-size:15px;">This is the paragraph text size. I used around 15px for the font of the paragraph so it's slightly smaller than the heading and the sub-heading. interesting but random fact just to fit space, I originally took computer science because I wanted to become a software engineer, but later switched to the path of chemical engineering.</p>
